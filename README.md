Dynamic Machine Learning Model Selector with Automated Visualizations 🚀📊
This project automates the process of selecting the best machine learning model for a given dataset and dynamically generates insightful visualizations for the most important features. It simplifies data analysis, model selection, and visualization in one seamless workflow.

Features ✨
Automatic Model Selection 🧠: Uses LazyPredict to identify the best machine learning model (classification or regression) based on dataset characteristics.
Data Cleaning 🧹: Handles missing values, duplicate rows, and feature scaling automatically.
Feature Importance Analysis 🔍: Highlights the most important features using the selected model.
Dynamic Visualizations 📈:
Boxplots
Violin plots
Scatterplots
Saves Visualizations 🖼️: All graphs are saved dynamically in a specified folder for easy access.
Technologies Used 💻
Python 🐍
Libraries:
LazyPredict for model selection
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations
Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model training
Pandas for data manipulation
Setup Instructions ⚙️
1. Clone the Repository 🛠️
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies 📦
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Project 🚀
Open the project in Google Colab or your local environment.
Place your dataset in the working directory (or use the default dataset provided).
Run the script step-by-step:
Data cleaning
Model selection
Visualization generation
4. Access Visualizations 📂
Generated visualizations are saved in the feature_visualizations folder. You can preview or download them for analysis.

How to Use the Code 📋
Load Your Dataset: Replace the default dataset (Iris or Diabetes) with your dataset by updating the relevant part of the script:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
Run the Script: Execute the script in order. The project will:

Clean your data
Select the best machine learning model
Generate and save visualizations for the most important features
Check Results:

View the model comparison table in the output.
Open the feature_visualizations folder to analyze the graphs.
